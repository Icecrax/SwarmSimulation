# What I learned:
* Working with vectors and forces
* Practicing Design by contract (Pre, Post, Inv comments)

# Task:
Simulate a bird swarm. The color of the birds represents the different height they are at.

More info about the their behaivior and how they can be simulated in this paper: [Boids by Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/index.html)

**Note: On this task I worked with two other colleges at the TU. And there is still one bug left unfix which causes freezing of the simulation from time to time.**
